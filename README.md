# SystemDocs
Currently a host of all the documentation for my projects. View it [here](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev)
I'm still building the website itself, so you won't be able to find any real documentation yet, but you can find an example document [here.](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev/docs/example)

## Future Roadmap
In the future I am planning to change this website to be a Google Docs/Microsoft Word esque clone, using a design I like better, is open source, and is saved directly to your hard drive.
