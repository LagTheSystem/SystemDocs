# SystemDocs
Currently a host of all the documentation for my projects. View it [here](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev)
I'm still building the website itself, so you won't be able to find any real documentation yet, but you can find an example document [here.](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev/docs/example)

## Future Roadmap
While a specific roadmap hasn't been made yet, I do have some possible plans for the future. I currently believe this project could go one of two ways, it will either be:

    a. An open source word processing app accessible through the web or an app

        or

    b. An open source framework for designing simple documentation websites
