# SystemDocs
Currently a host of all the documentation for my projects. View it [here](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev)
I'm still building the website itself, so you won't be able to find any real documentation yet, but you can find an example document [here.](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev/docs/example)

## Future Plans

I am currently working on changing the direction of this project into a sort of Google Docs clone.
You can check on the development of this on my [experimental page](https://docs.lagthesystem.dev/experiments/example)
